# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

hi everyone :)

## Project/Goals

My goal is to complete the tasks assigned using the most rudimentary, succinct SQL queries possible in order to acheive the reasults.

## Process

### I. First step is to successfully format everything, import everything with no issues, etc. 

### II. Next step is to attempt to write the correct SQL query as logically succinct as I can, and then troubleshoot from there.

## Results

I was able to successfully acheive my desired results without any complicated equations beyond what I have so far learned in this course.

## Challenges

A challenge was navigating SQL and updating my computer repo to GitHub and troubleshooting when there were errors and how to fix before moving on,

## Future Goals

If I had more time, I would have taken the time to create more sophisticated queries
